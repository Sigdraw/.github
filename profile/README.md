Sigdraw is building modern RTL and VLSI development tools for modern developers. With the influx of talent and interest to the hardware space with the advent of AI, we thought the engineers behind these chips deserved better tooling. Sigdraw is built web-first, aiming for seamless collaboration between team members for both development and debugging. Our revolutionary user interface design aims to optimize development time by providing live, digestable simulations of designs.
